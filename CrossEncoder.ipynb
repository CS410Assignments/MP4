    "Cross encoders are an easy to understand application of Language Models as they treate relevance as a binary classification task. A query and a document are concatenated and separated by [SEP] token and a model learns to predict if a query document pair is relevant or not. This method is incredibly effective despite its simplicity. While effective, this approach is not efficient from an inference perspective. If we want to run this on 10,000 documents and 10,000 queries we will have to use our model 100m times while the same approach requires 20,000 model calls for a bi-encoder. This inefficiency is why cross-encoders are mostly used for reranking. "
